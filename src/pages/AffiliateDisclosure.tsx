            Our Promise
          </h2>
          <p>
            We only recommend products and services that we genuinely believe in and that align with
            our values of intentional living. Whether we earn a commission or not does not influence
            our recommendations.

            No Additional Cost
          </h2>
          <p>
            Using our affiliate links does not cost you anything extra. The price remains the same
            for you, and your support through these links helps us continue creating free content
            and resources.

            Transparency
          </h2>
          <p>
            We believe in full transparency. All affiliate links are clearly marked, and we will
            always disclose when a link may earn us a commission.
