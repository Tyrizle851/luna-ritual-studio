## 2. WEAKNESSES & CHALLENGES

### ⚠️ **Market Saturation Risk**
- **Digital affirmation market is crowded** - Etsy, Creative Market, individual creators
- **Low barriers to entry** - anyone can create text on image
- **Price competition** - many sellers offer $2-5 affirmations
- **Need strong differentiation** - your AI customization helps, but must be marketed well

### ⚠️ **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
- **Social media advertising is expensive** - TikTok/Instagram ads can be $0.50-$2+ per click
- **Conversion rates vary** - typical e-commerce: 1-3% (affirmations might be 2-5%)
- **Break-even analysis needed**:
  - If CAC = $5 and average order = $12, need 42% margin (you have 95%+, so OK)
  - But if CAC = $10, need 83% margin (still OK, but tighter)
  - **Challenge**: Getting organic reach without paid ads

### ⚠️ **Dependency on Social Media Algorithms**
- **Platform changes can kill reach** - Instagram/TikTok algorithm updates
- **Content fatigue** - users scroll past ads quickly
- **Need consistent posting** - your automation helps, but quality matters
- **Platform risk** - account bans, policy changes

### ⚠️ **Physical Product Inventory Risk**
- **Current physical products** (fashion, candles, supplements) require inventory
- **Cash flow tied up** in unsold stock
- **Storage costs** if not dropshipped
- **Return/refund handling** for physical items

### ⚠️ **Affiliate Revenue Volatility**
- **Commission rates vary** (typically 5-15%)
- **No control over product quality** - bad affiliate products hurt your brand
- **Lower margins** than digital products
- **Customer leaves your site** - less control over experience

### ⚠️ **Digital Product Piracy Risk**
- **Easy to screenshot/share** - no DRM on images
- **Need strong branding** - make people want the "official" version
- **Community building** - loyal customers less likely to pirate
