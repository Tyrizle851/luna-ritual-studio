  "conclusion": "DALL-E 3 image generation status (success vs GitHub fallback) cannot be definitively determined due to n8n cloud instance security and authentication requirements. Execution #645 completed successfully (57.246s runtime), indicating the workflow ran without fatal errors. However, individual node outputs including DALL-E API responses and handler node processing results are protected by authorization barriers. The data exists within n8n but requires authenticated access to retrieve.",

  "next_steps_recommendation": [
    "PRIORITY: Request n8n API access token or credentials for programmatic data retrieval",
    "ALTERNATIVE 1: Have authorized user (tyrizle851@gmail.com) manually inspect node outputs in n8n UI",
    "ALTERNATIVE 2: Export execution #645 data as JSON file for offline analysis",
    "ALTERNATIVE 3: Add webhook logging to nodes to externally track DALL-E success/fallback",
    "ALTERNATIVE 4: Check n8n execution logs if available outside the UI",
    "LONG-TERM: Implement execution data export automation or monitoring dashboard"
