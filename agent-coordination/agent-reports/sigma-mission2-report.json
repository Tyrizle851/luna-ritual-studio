    "Consider adding error handling/retry logic in the workflow"
  ],
  "conclusion": "While the Sora video nodes exist and are configured correctly, authorization restrictions prevent detailed inspection of execution results. The workflow IS running (20+ executions), but experiences intermittent failures (~2 consecutive errors followed by success). Root cause diagnosis requires either elevated permissions or direct server/API log access."
